# Personal macOS configuration/setup

## Information
Please, do not use my setup as is. If you want to give it a try, I suggest you to fork my repo first, review the code, change it and tweak it to your needs. Don't just blindly run it, because it may not be something that you want/need.

## Installation
`mkdir ~/.dot && curl -L "https://github.com/dvlden/macos-config/tarball/master" | tar -xz -C ~/.dot --strip-components=1 && cd ~/.dot && sh bootstrap`
